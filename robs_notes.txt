# Initial Testing

Take built go bin and place it in root level module so that `terraform init` can pick it up

## ACC

Thoughts on how to test this:

* Check that for given `initialize_with_readme` that the complete repo exists with a readme at the readme_url
  thats expected via the received API response. This only matters upon initial spinup of the project/repo and
  shouldnt need to be stored within the statefile since the git repo will be the source of truth for any files
  within it. Including this initial readme.
